I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in mathematical economics in the University of Pennsylvania's School of Arts and Sciences with a minor in statistics from the Wharton school. I conduct research with the group Research on Policing Reform and Accountability ([RoPRA](https://policingresearch.org/)) working with [Dr. Dean Knox](http://www.dcknox.com/). Currently, I'm creating a tool to automate causal inference from incomplete or imperfect data and building an artificial intelligence algorithim to automate analysis of police body-worn camera footage. I'm also completing my senior thesis advised by [Dr. Margaux Luflade](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/people/margaux-luflade) investigating college application behavior. 

In the past, I've worked as a research assistant for the [Penn Wharton Budget Model](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/), a nonpartisan, research-based initiative that provides accurate, accessible and transparent economic analysis of public policyâ€™s fiscal impact directed by Dr. Kent Smetters. I've also spent time as a summer consultant at [Bates White Economic Consulting](https://www.bateswhite.com/), advising firms on anti-trust implications of potential mergers. 

I've also completed consulting for the Wharton Analytics Fellows, a highly selective fellowship program that allows motivated Wharton undergraduates, MBAs, and graduate students to put their analytics skills to the test in the real world. Through my experience and coursework I've become proficient in R, and Python, along with their assorted machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization packages. 

I'm passionate about making the world a better place through data and I'm applying to doctoral programs starting in the fall of 2022. My research interests are in computational social science, causal infrence, and machine learning.
