I am a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in mathematical economics in the University of Pennsylvania's School of Arts and Sciences with a minor in statistics from the Wharton school. I am a research assistant at Research on Policing Reform and Accountability (RoPRA) working with Dr. Dean Knox. Currently, I am creating a tool to automate causal inference from incomplete or imperfect data and building an artificial intelligence algorithim to automate analysis of police body-worn camera footage. I'm also completing my senior thesis advised by Dr. Margaux Luflade investigating college application behavior. 

In the past, I've worked as a research assistant for the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan, research-based initiative that provides accurate, accessible and transparent economic analysis of public policyâ€™s fiscal impact directed by Dr. Kent Smetters. I've also spent time as a summer consultant at Bates White Economic Consulting, advising firms on anti-trust implications of potential mergers.
