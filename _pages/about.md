I am a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in mathematical economics in the University of Pennsylvania's School of Arts and Sciences with a minor in statistics from the Wharton school. I am a research assistant at Research on Policing Reform and Accountability ([RoPRA](https://policingresearch.org/)) working with [Dr. Dean Knox](http://www.dcknox.com/). Currently, I am creating a tool to automate causal inference from incomplete or imperfect data and building an artificial intelligence algorithim to automate analysis of police body-worn camera footage. I'm also completing my senior thesis advised by [Dr. Margaux Luflade](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/people/margaux-luflade) investigating college application behavior. 

In the past, I've worked as a research assistant for the [Penn Wharton Budget Model](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/), a nonpartisan, research-based initiative that provides accurate, accessible and transparent economic analysis of public policyâ€™s fiscal impact directed by Dr. Kent Smetters. I've also spent time as a summer consultant at [Bates White Economic Consulting](https://www.bateswhite.com/), advising firms on anti-trust implications of potential mergers.
