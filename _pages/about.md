I am a PhD candidate in Operations, Information, and Decisions at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. My research examines how organizations monitor and discipline frontline workers when performance is difficult to observe and discretion is high. I study these questions in the context of policing, focusing on officer discipline, body-worn camera auditing, and racial inequality in administrative data. More broadly, my work engages with organizational control, fairness and legitimacy, and the unintended consequences of new monitoring technologies such as AI.
